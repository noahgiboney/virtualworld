# Virtual World
Project for CS203 

This project was split into three parts throughout the quarter.

## Part One

The codebase for the virtual world given was sloppy and had purposely low cohesion and high coupling. Using OOP principles
I refactored the code base to achieve high class cohesion and low coupling. This was done through the means of abstract classes
and interfaces. Representing the Entity's as parent abstract classes and their functionality based on interfaces greatly
reduced repeated code.
