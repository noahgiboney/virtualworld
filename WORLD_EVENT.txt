1) The event is triggered by clicking on one of the four volcanoes that are scattered across the map. The event is only triggered by clicking within
a 10 tiles radius of the volcano. The event will not be triggered if you click elsewhere on the map.

2) When the event is triggered, the specific volcano that was clicked erupts and has an animation that lasts for 2 seconds, this also causes the river
to flood with lava near the volcano that takes the place of the water. Also, when the volcano erupts, it wakes up the spider nests across the world
and spawns in six spiders. The clicking of volcano's can be done continuously to flood the river with lava and wake up spiders.

3) These spiders will seek out dudes to kill them and transform them the dudes into a static blood entity that means the dude has been killed. After this
even the fairy's behavior is also affected as now the fairy must revive the dudes and kill spiders to protect the dude. The fairy must choose between the
shortest entity if the blood and spider are both present. This way the fairy is most effective with its task. If there is no spiders the fairy will revive trees as normal.
Lastly, the dude will remain chopping trees while the spider eruptions occur, although they will be getting killed in the process.

4) The new entities is a spider that spawns with volcano eruptions, it should seek out dudes and kills them, it is also being hunted by the fairy's as they
have to protect the dude.
